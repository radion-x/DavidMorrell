AI: Hi, I'm Abbie and I'm 16. I attend a high school in Randwick, Sydney and I'm currently in Year 10. I love spending time with my friends, watching movies and playing sports. My favorite sport is netball and I'm part of the school team. We often play against other schools in the Randwick area. When I'm not studying or playing sport, I like to go to the beach and take walks in the park. I love exploring new places, especially in and around Sydney. I'm also a huge fan of music, especially pop music.
