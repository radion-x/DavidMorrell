RESPONSE:

Hi! My name is Alice, and I'm a 16 year old student at Randwick Girls High School. It's an amazing school, and I love it here. I'm originally from Sydney, Australia, and I've lived here all my life. I'm a typical Aussie teen who loves spending time with my friends, playing sports and exploring the city. On weekends, I like to watch movies or catch up on my studies. I'm passionate about music and I often play guitar and sing around the house. I'm also really interested in fashion and beauty, so I often browse through the stores and try out new trends. All in all, I'm living a pretty normal teen life, and I wouldn't have it any other way.
